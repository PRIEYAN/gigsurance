# Disruptions Covering under Gigsurance







<div align="center">

**Phase 1 MVP: 60-Second Onboarding + Autonomous Payout System**

*Building the future of gig worker protection, one agent at a time*

</div>

---

## The Problem

India's 15+ million gig workers face a critical vulnerability: when extreme weather, natural disasters, or environmental disruptions strike, their income stops instantly. Traditional insurance fails them completely.

### Traditional Insurance Model

```
Incident Occurs → User Files Claim → Documents Verified → Survey Done → Payment After Weeks
```

**Pain Points:**
- Weeks-long claim processing
- Complex document verification
- Manual survey requirements
- No coverage for external disruptions
- Designed for salaried workers, not gig economy

### The Gig Worker Reality

When heavy rainfall floods Chennai, delivery zones shut down. When cyclones hit, workers can't operate. When pollution levels spike, health risks prevent work. **Zero income. Zero protection.**

---

## Our Solution

**Gigsurance** transforms insurance through **parametric automation** - when a qualifying event occurs, payouts trigger automatically. No claims. No paperwork. Just instant protection.

**The Innovation:** Four autonomous AI agents work 24/7 to detect disruptions, validate events, calculate fair payouts, and execute instant transfers - all without human intervention.

### How It Works

```mermaid

    A[Disaster Event] --> B[Agent 1: Monitor]

    C --> D[Agent 3: Calculate Payout]
    D --> E[Agent 4: Instant Transfer]
    E --> F[Worker Notified]
    
    style A fill:#ff6b6b
    style E fill:#51cf66
    style F fill:#51cf66
```

**Example:** Rainfall > 120mm in Chennai → Automatic ₹500 payout to all affected workers within minutes.

---

## Key Innovations

### Autonomous Agent System

**Four AI agents work continuously to detect, validate, and execute payouts:**

- **Agent 1: Disaster Monitor** - Continuously polls weather, news, disaster APIs
- **Agent 2: Zone Classifier** - Maps disruptions to specific delivery zones using NLP
- **Agent 3: Fund Allocator** - Calculates individual payouts based on income baseline
- **Agent 4: Payout Executor** - Instantly transfers funds via UPI

### Real-Time Fraud Detection

**Multi-layered security system:**

- GPS spoofing detection through movement pattern analysis
- Behavioral verification (active hours, delivery routes, speed consistency)
- Multi-device triangulation prevention
- Trust score system (0-100) updated in real-time

### Dynamic Pricing Model

**Premium adjusts based on:**

- **Location Risk Score** - Historical disruption frequency in zone
- **Persona Type** - Food delivery vs Quick commerce vs E-commerce
- **Work Pattern** - Hours per day, days per week
- **Real-Time Conditions** - Current weather trends, seasonal patterns

### Predictive Intelligence

AI analyzes historical data to suggest optimal premium plans before disruptions occur, helping workers make informed decisions.

- Severe pollution (AQI thresholds)
- Curfews and lockdowns
- Local area strikes
- Market crashes
- Platform/server outages

### Not Covered
- Health or life issues
- Accidents
- Vehicle repairs
- Holidays
- Driver out of service (without disruption)
- Location outside registered zone

---

## Innovation Highlights

### Parametric Automation
Unlike traditional insurance, payouts are triggered by **objective data** (rainfall mm, wind speed km/h) rather than subjective claims. This eliminates fraud, speeds up processing, and ensures fairness.

### Zone-Level Precision
We don't just detect city-wide events - our AI maps disruptions to **specific delivery zones**, ensuring only affected workers receive payouts.

### Rolling Weekly Cycles
Each worker has an individualized 7-day cycle starting from their signup time, not a fixed Monday-Sunday schedule. This accommodates part-time workers and flexible schedules.

### Cooldown Period
New users have a 6-hour cooldown before coverage activates, preventing exploitation during active disruptions.

### Location Intelligence
System automatically detects if a worker has been in a different city for 24+ hours and prompts location update, ensuring accurate coverage and pricing.
